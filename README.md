# AzureFunctions-TheLongRun-Leagues
Demo code for CQRS on Event Grid

This project contains the Azure Functions App used to demonstrate the concept of running a *CQRS* / *Event Sourcing* backed system on a serverless Azure Functions backbone.

The libraries of the actual performing of *Event Sourcing* functions over event streams come from the related *CQRS Azure* project under this same root account.

Orchestration Bindings
======================

These bindings allow for event stream backed orchestrations to call out to each other
and receive a call back accress to which results should be posted.

e.g. 
  [ Query ] ---> [ Identifier Group ] ---> [ Classifier ]
      ^                 ^       |                    |
      |                 |       |                    |
	  |                 \_______|____________________/
	  |                         |
	  \_________________________/

For an example of how this sort of thing is done, look at the DurableTask orchestration
(https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask/Bindings/OrchestrationTriggerAttributeBindingProvider.cs)

For information about the constituent parts of bindings, use this documentation:

Routing
-------
Each orchestrator has routing in the form:
Domain/Type/Name/Instance
Where type is [Group|Projection|Query|Command|Classifier]

e.g.
TheLongRun-Leagues/Command/Add-League/{1234-ABCD1-0A098A123E1F}

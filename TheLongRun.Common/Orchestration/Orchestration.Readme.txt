Orchestration overview
======================

Command and query handlers are implemented as a sequence of steps which are backed by
an event stream of the events they log while being processed.

Each handler instance is identified by a GUID and the event stream is backed by an
append-blob named with that GUID and in a folder indicating the specific command
or query type.

A handler does not lock the event stream as it may spawn tasks which will return their
results asynchronously (such as getting the membership of an identifier group or running
a projection).

Identifier Groups
=================

An identifier group is an attempt to bring some of the set logic familiar to RDBMS based systems to
the "Event Sourcing" space.

It consists of applying a special form of projection, known as a "classifier" to each instance of a
particular aggregate and thereby deriving which are members of the particular group defined by that
classifier function.

As each event stream is independent the classifiers can be run in parallel to improve performance of this
process.

This is not a standard event sourcing paradigm - it is more of an experiment - so I have kept all of the 
code pertaining to it in a separate project called "CQRSAzure.EventSourcing.IdentifierGroups".

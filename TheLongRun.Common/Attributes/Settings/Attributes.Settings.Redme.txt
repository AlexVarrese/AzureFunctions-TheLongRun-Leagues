Settings
========

These classes allow the settings for the event sourcing back end(s) to be configured.

They are external to the function app as it is possible (maybe even likely) that the same
event streams might be used by a function app and maybe a more traditional app or service.

The supported interfaces come from the [CQRSAzure.EventSourcing] project.
